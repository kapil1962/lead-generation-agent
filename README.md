ðŸš€ **Lead Generation Automation â€“ Google Maps to Email Extractor** is an end-to-end automated workflow built with n8n that simplifies the process of finding business leads. It automatically scrapes Google Maps for business listings, extracts their website URLs, and intelligently scans each site to find valid email addresses using a regex-based approach.

The workflow includes smart scraping logic with built-in delays to prevent IP blocking and duplicate removal for clean data. Results are automatically organized and exported to Google Sheets, making it easy to access and manage your leads in real time.

This project is ideal for marketers, sales teams, and agencies looking to automate manual lead collection tasks. With configurable filters, delay timers, and seamless integrations, it ensures high-quality, accurate, and ethical data extraction.

Itâ€™s fully customizable, easy to deploy, and helps save hours of manual work â€” turning a complex multi-step process into a single automated flow.
